## 🛠 Setup

```sh
pnpm install

This repository uses pnpm's `minimumReleaseAge` safeguard. Dependency versions
published less than 2 days ago are blocked during install to reduce supply-chain
risk.

To run tests locally:

```sh
pnpm test
```

2. Clone your forked repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/divider.git
cd divider
```

3. Create a feature branch

```sh
git checkout -b your-feature-name
```
